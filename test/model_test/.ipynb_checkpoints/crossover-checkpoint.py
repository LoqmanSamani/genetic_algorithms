def apply_crossover(elite_individuals, individual, crossover_alpha, sim_crossover, compartment_crossover, param_crossover):
    """
    Applies crossover operations between an individual and a randomly selected elite individual.

    This function blends various aspects (simulation variables, compartment properties, and parameters) of the
    selected elite individual with the current individual based on specified crossover operations. The blending is
    controlled by the `crossover_alpha` parameter, which determines the weighting between the elite and the current
    individual's attributes.

    Parameters:
        - elite_individuals (list of numpy.ndarray): A list of elite individuals from which one is randomly selected to
          participate in the crossover.
        - individual (numpy.ndarray): The individual that will undergo the crossover, having its attributes blended with
          those of the selected elite individual.
        - crossover_alpha (float): The weighting factor for the crossover, ranging between 0 and 1. A higher value gives
          more weight to the original individual's attributes.
        - sim_crossover (bool): If True, the crossover is applied to the simulation variables.
        - compartment_crossover (bool): If True, the crossover is applied to the compartment properties.
        - param_crossover (bool): If True, the crossover is applied to the species and complex parameters.

    Returns:
        - numpy.ndarray: The updated individual after applying the specified crossover operations.
